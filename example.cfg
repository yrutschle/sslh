# List of protocols
#
# Each protocol entry consists of:
#   name: name of the probe. These are listed on the command
#   line (ssh -?), plus 'regex' and 'timeout'.

#   service: (optional) libwrap service name (see hosts_access(5))
#   host, port: where to connect when this probe succeeds
#   log_level:  0 to turn off logging
#               1 to log each incoming connection
#   keepalive:  Should TCP keepalive be on or off for that
#               connection (default is off)
#   fork: Should a new process be forked for this protocol?
#         (only useful for sslh-select)
#   tfo_ok: Set to true if the server supports TCP FAST OPEN
#   resolve_on_forward: Set to true if server address should be resolved on
#         (every) newly incoming connection (again)
#   transparent: Set to true to proxy this protocol
#         transparently (server sees the remote client IP
#         address). Same as the global option, but per-protocol
#   is_unix: [true|false] connect to a UNIX socket. The host
#   field becomes the pathname to the socket, and the port
#   field is unused (but necessary).
#
#  Probe-specific options:
# (sslh will try each probe in order they are declared, and
# connect to the first that matches.)
#
#       tls:
#               sni_hostnames:  list of FQDN for that target. Each name can
#               include wildcard following glob(7) rules.

#               alpn_protocols: list of ALPN protocols for that target, see:
#               https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-extensiontype-values/tls-extensiontype-values.xhtml#alpn-protocol-ids
#
#               if both sni_hostnames AND alpn_protocols are specified, both must match
#
#               if neither are set, it is just checked whether this is the TLS protocol or not
#
#               Obviously set the most specific probes
#               first, and if you use TLS with no ALPN/SNI
#               set it as the last TLS probe
#       regex:
#               regex_patterns: list of patterns to match for
#               that target.
#   
# You can specify several of 'regex' and 'tls'.
#
# If you want to filter on incoming IP addresses, you can
# use libwrap which will use /etc/hosts.allow and
# /etc/hosts.deny.
