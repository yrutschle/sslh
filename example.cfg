# List of protocols
#
# Each protocol entry consists of:
#   name: name of the protocol
#   service: (optional) libwrap service name (see hosts_access(5))
#   host: host name to connect that protocol
#   port: port number to connect that protocol
#   probe: "builtin" or a list of regular expressions
#   
# In case of timeout sslh will connect to the first
# protocol: this should be SSH.
# SSL should have a "always true" probe, and come last.
# sslh will try each probe in order they are declared, and
# connect to the first that matches.
