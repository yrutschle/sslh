v1.10:
	Fixed calls referring to sockaddr length so they work
	with FreeBSD.

	Try target addresses in turn until one works if
	there are several (e.g. "localhost:22" resolves to
	an IPv6 address and an IPv4 address and sshd does
	not listen on IPv6).

	Fixed sslh-fork so killing the head process kills
	the listener processes.

	Heavily cleaned up test suite. Added stress test
	t_load script. Added coverage (requires lcov).

	Support for XMPP (Arnaud Gendre).

	Updated README.MacOSX (Aaron Madlon-Kay).

v1.9: 02AUG2011
	WARNING: This version does not work with FreeBSD and
	derivatives!

	WARNING: Options changed, you'll need to update your
	start-up scripts! Log format changed, you'll need to
	update log processing scripts!

	Now supports IPv6 throughout (both on listening and
	forwarding)

	Logs now contain IPv6 addresses, local forwarding
	address, and resolves names (unless --numeric is
	specified).

	Introduced long options.

	Options -l, -s and -o replaced by their long
	counterparts.

	Defaults for SSL and SSH options suppressed (it's 
	legitimate to want to use sslh to mux OpenVPN and 
	tinc while not caring about SSH nor SSL).

	Bind to multiple addresses with multiple -p options.

	Support for tinc VPN (experimental).

	Numeric logging option.

v1.8: 15JUL2011
	Changed log format to make it possible to link
	connections to subsequent logs from other services.

	Updated CentOS init.d script (Andre Krajnik).

	Fixed zombie issue with OpenBSD (The SA_NOCLDWAIT flag is not
	propagated to the child process, so we set up signals after
	the fork.) (François FRITZ)

	Added -o "OpenVPN" and OpenVPN probing and support.

	Added single-threaded, select(2)-based version.

	Added support for "Bold" SSH clients (clients that speak first)
	Thanks to Guillaume Ricaud for spotting a regression
	bug.

	Added -f "foreground" option.

	Added test suite. (only tests connexions. No test for libwrap,
	setsid, setuid and so on) and corresponding 'make
	test' target.

	Added README.MacOSX (thanks Aaron Madlon-Kay)

	Documented use with proxytunnel and corkscrew in
	README.

	
v1.7: 01FEB2010
	Added CentOS init.d script (Andre Krajnik).

	Fixed default ssl address inconsistancy, now
	defaults to "localhost:443" and fixed documentation
	accordingly (pointed by Markus Schalke).

	Children no longer bind to the listen socket, so
	parent server can be stopped without killing an
	active child (pointed by Matthias Buecher).

	Inetd support (Dima Barsky).

v1.6: 25APR2009
	Added -V, version option.

	Install target directory configurable in Makefile

	Changed syslog prefix in auth.log to "sslh[%pid]"

	Man page

	new 'make install' and 'make install-debian' targets

	PID file now specified using -P command line option

	Actually fixed zombie generation (the v1.5 patch got
	lost, doh!)


v1.5: 10DEC2008
	Fixed zombie generation.

	Added support scripts (), Makefile.

	Changed all 'connexions' to 'connections' to please
	pesky users. Damn users.

v1.4: 13JUL2008
	Added libwrap support for ssh service (Christian Weinberger)
	Only SSH is libwraped, not SSL.

v1.3: 14MAY2008
	Added parsing for local interface to listen on

	Changed default SSL connection to port 442 (443 doesn't make
	sense as a default as we're already listening on 443)

	Syslog incoming connections

v1.2: 12MAY2008
	Fixed compilation warning for AMD64 (Thx Daniel Lange)

v1.1: 21MAY2007
	Making sslhc more like a real daemon:
	* If $PIDFILE is defined, write first PID to it upon startup
	* Fork at startup (detach from terminal)
	(thanks to http://www.enderunix.org/docs/eng/daemon.php -- good checklist)
	* Less memory usage (?)

v1.0: 
	Basic functionality: privilege dropping, target hostnames and ports
	configurable.
