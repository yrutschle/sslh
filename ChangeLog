vNEXT: 
	Added TCP_FASTOPEN support for client sockets (if
	tfo_ok is specified in their configuration) and for
	listenint socket, if all client protocols support it.
	(Craig Andrews)

	Added 'minlength' option to skip a probe if less
	than that many bytes have been received (mostly for
	regex)

	Moved configuration and command-line management to
	use conf2struct. Hopefully this should be transparent
	to users.

	Update Let's Encrypt entry in example.cfg for tls-alpn-01
	challenges; tls-sni-* challenges are now deprecated.

v1.20: 20NOV2018
	Added support for socks5 protocol (Eugene Protozanov)

	New probing method:
	Before, probes were tried in order, repeating on the
	same probe as long it returned PROBE_AGAIN before
	moving to the next one. This means a probe which
	requires a lot of data (i.e. returne PROBE_AGAIN for
	a long time) could prevent sucessful matches from 
	subsequent probes. The configuration file needed to
	take that into account.

	Now, all probes are tried each time new data is
	found. If any probe matches, use it. If at least one
	probe requires more data, wait for more. If all
	probes failed, connect to the last one. So the only
	thing to know when writing the configuration file is
	that 'anyprot' needs to be last.

	Test suite heavily refactored; `t` uses `test.cfg`
	to decide which probes to test and all setup is
	automatic; probes get tested with 'fast' (entire
	first message in one packet) and 'slow' (one byte at
	a time); when SNI/ALPN are defined, all combinations
	are tested.

	Old 'tls' probe removed, 'sni_alpn' probe renamed as 'tls'.
	You'll need to change 'sni_alpn' to 'tls' in
	your configuration file, if ever you used it.

v1.19: 20JAN2018
	Added 'syslog_facility' configuration option to
	specify where to log.

	TLS now supports SNI and ALPN (Travis Burtrum),
	including support for Let's Encrypt challenges
	(Jonathan McCrohan)

	ADB probe. (Mike Frysinger)

	Added per-protocol 'fork' option. (Oleg Oshmyan)

	Added chroot option. (Mike Frysinger)

	A truckload of bug fixes and documentation
	improvements (Various contributors)

v1.18:	29MAR2016
	Added USELIBPCRE to make use of regex engine
	optional.

	Added support for RFC4366 SNI and RFC7301 ALPN
	(Travis Burtrum)

	Changed connection log to include the name of the probe that
	triggered.

	Changed configuration file format: 'probe' field is
	no longer required, 'name' field can now contain
	'tls' or 'regex', with corresponding options (see
	example.cfg)
	Added 'log_level' option to each protocol, which
	allows to turn off generation of log at each
	connection.
	Added 'keepalive' option.

v1.17: 	09MAR2015
	Support RFC5952-style IPv6 addresses, e.g. [::]:443.

	Transparant proxy support for FreeBSD.
	(Ruben van Staveren)

	Using -F with no argument will try
	/etc/sslh/sslh.cfg and then /etc/sslh.cfg as
	configuration files. (argument to -F can no longer
	be separated from the option by a space, e.g. must
	be -Ffoo.cfg)

	Call setgroups() before setgid() (fixes potential
	privilege escalation).
	(Lars Vogdt)

	Use portable way of getting modified time for OSX
	support.
	(Aaron Madlon-Kay)

	Example configuration for fail2ban.
	(Every Mouw)

v1.16:	11FEB2014
	Probes made more resilient, to incoming data
	containing NULLs. Also made them behave properly
	when receiving too short packets to probe on the
	first incoming packet.
	(Ondrej Kuzník)

	Libcap support: Keep only CAP_NET_ADMIN if started
	as root with transparent proxying and dropping
	priviledges (enable USELIBCAP in Makefile). This
	avoids having to mess with filesystem capabilities.
	(Sebastian Schmidt/yath)

	Fixed bugs related to getpeername that would cause
	sslh to quit erroneously (getpeername can return
	actual errors if connections are dropped before
	getting to getpeername).

	Set IP_FREEDBIND if available to bind to addresses
	that don't yet exist.

v1.15:	27JUL2013
	Added --transparent option for transparent proxying.
	See README for iptables magic and capability
	management.

	Fixed bug in sslh-select: if number of opened file
	descriptor became bigger than FD_SETSIZE, bad things
	would happen.

	Fixed bug in sslh-select: if socket dropped while
	deferred_data was present, sslh-select would crash.

	Increased FD_SETSIZE for Cygwin, as the default 64
	is too low for even moderate load.

v1.14: 21DEC2012
	Corrected OpenVPN probe to support pre-shared secret
	mode (OpenVPN port-sharing code is... wrong). Thanks
	to Kai Ellinger for help in investigating and
	testing.

	Added an actual TLS/SSL probe.

	Added configurable --on-timeout protocol
	specification.

	Added a --anyprot protocol probe (equivalent to what
	--ssl was).

	Makefile respects the user's compiler and CFLAG
	choices (falling back to the current values if
	undefined), as well as LDFLAGS. 
	(Michael Palimaka)

	Added "After" and "KillMode" to systemd.sslh.service
	(Thomas Weißschuh).

	Added LSB tags to etc.init.d.sslh
	(Thomas Varis).

v1.13: 18MAY2012
	Write PID file before dropping privileges.

	Added --background, which overrides 'foreground'
	configuration file setting.

	Added example systemd service file from Archlinux in
	scripts/
	https://projects.archlinux.org/svntogit/community.git/tree/trunk/sslh.service?h=packages/sslh
	(Sébastien Luttringer)

v1.12: 08MAY2012
	Added support for configuration file.

	New protocol probes can be defined using regular
	expressions that match the first packet sent by the
	client.

	sslh now connects timed out connections to the first
	configured protocol instead of 'ssh' (just make sure
	ssh is the first defined protocol).

	sslh now tries protocols in the order in which they
	are defined (just make sure sslh is the last defined
	protocol).

v1.11: 21APR2012
	WARNING: defaults have been removed for --user and
	--pidfile options, update your start-up scripts!

	No longer stop sslh when reverse DNS requests fail
	for logging.

	Added HTTP probe.

	No longer create new session if running in
	foreground.

	No longer default to changing user to 'nobody'. If
	--user isn't specified, just run as current user.

	No longer create PID file by default, it should be
	explicitely set with --pidfile.

	No longer log to syslog if in foreground. Logs are
	instead output to stderr.

	The four changes above make it straightforward to
	integrate sslh with systemd, and should help with
	launchd.

v1.10: 27NOV2011
	Fixed calls referring to sockaddr length so they work
	with FreeBSD.

	Try target addresses in turn until one works if
	there are several (e.g. "localhost:22" resolves to
	an IPv6 address and an IPv4 address and sshd does
	not listen on IPv6).

	Fixed sslh-fork so killing the head process kills
	the listener processes.

	Heavily cleaned up test suite. Added stress test
	t_load script. Added coverage (requires lcov).

	Support for XMPP (Arnaud Gendre).

	Updated README.MacOSX (Aaron Madlon-Kay).

v1.9: 02AUG2011
	WARNING: This version does not work with FreeBSD and
	derivatives!

	WARNING: Options changed, you'll need to update your
	start-up scripts! Log format changed, you'll need to
	update log processing scripts!

	Now supports IPv6 throughout (both on listening and
	forwarding)

	Logs now contain IPv6 addresses, local forwarding
	address, and resolves names (unless --numeric is
	specified).

	Introduced long options.

	Options -l, -s and -o replaced by their long
	counterparts.

	Defaults for SSL and SSH options suppressed (it's 
	legitimate to want to use sslh to mux OpenVPN and 
	tinc while not caring about SSH nor SSL).

	Bind to multiple addresses with multiple -p options.

	Support for tinc VPN (experimental).

	Numeric logging option.

v1.8: 15JUL2011
	Changed log format to make it possible to link
	connections to subsequent logs from other services.

	Updated CentOS init.d script (Andre Krajnik).

	Fixed zombie issue with OpenBSD (The SA_NOCLDWAIT flag is not
	propagated to the child process, so we set up signals after
	the fork.) (François FRITZ)

	Added -o "OpenVPN" and OpenVPN probing and support.

	Added single-threaded, select(2)-based version.

	Added support for "Bold" SSH clients (clients that speak first)
	Thanks to Guillaume Ricaud for spotting a regression
	bug.

	Added -f "foreground" option.

	Added test suite. (only tests connexions. No test for libwrap,
	setsid, setuid and so on) and corresponding 'make
	test' target.

	Added README.MacOSX (thanks Aaron Madlon-Kay)

	Documented use with proxytunnel and corkscrew in
	README.

	
v1.7: 01FEB2010
	Added CentOS init.d script (Andre Krajnik).

	Fixed default ssl address inconsistancy, now
	defaults to "localhost:443" and fixed documentation
	accordingly (pointed by Markus Schalke).

	Children no longer bind to the listen socket, so
	parent server can be stopped without killing an
	active child (pointed by Matthias Buecher).

	Inetd support (Dima Barsky).

v1.6: 25APR2009
	Added -V, version option.

	Install target directory configurable in Makefile

	Changed syslog prefix in auth.log to "sslh[%pid]"

	Man page

	new 'make install' and 'make install-debian' targets

	PID file now specified using -P command line option

	Actually fixed zombie generation (the v1.5 patch got
	lost, doh!)


v1.5: 10DEC2008
	Fixed zombie generation.

	Added support scripts (), Makefile.

	Changed all 'connexions' to 'connections' to please
	pesky users. Damn users.

v1.4: 13JUL2008
	Added libwrap support for ssh service (Christian Weinberger)
	Only SSH is libwraped, not SSL.

v1.3: 14MAY2008
	Added parsing for local interface to listen on

	Changed default SSL connection to port 442 (443 doesn't make
	sense as a default as we're already listening on 443)

	Syslog incoming connections

v1.2: 12MAY2008
	Fixed compilation warning for AMD64 (Thx Daniel Lange)

v1.1: 21MAY2007
	Making sslhc more like a real daemon:
	* If $PIDFILE is defined, write first PID to it upon startup
	* Fork at startup (detach from terminal)
	(thanks to http://www.enderunix.org/docs/eng/daemon.php -- good checklist)
	* Less memory usage (?)

v1.0: 
	Basic functionality: privilege dropping, target hostnames and ports
	configurable.
